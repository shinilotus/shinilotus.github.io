<h2>About</h2>

<p>I always knew I wanted to get into the games industry, but never really knew what my calling was. Being as into technology as I am, while researching jobs in the field, I stumbled upon software development. It is here where I began developing a passion for coding, working towards my <i>Associate Degree in Software Development.</i></p>
  
<p>I will have been working on my coding skills for about 2 years by the time I graduate in Spring of 2026, learning the intricate way code works together while studying at <i>The College of Western Idaho</i>. I plan on practicing coding on my off time as well, to further hone my skills. </p>
