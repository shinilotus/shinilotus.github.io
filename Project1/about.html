      <p>Founded in 2024, Build-A-Myth was started by the not-so mad scientist, Matt. Matt, growing up, had a distinct love for mythological creatures and was disappointed in
        the severe lack of availability in the world. Unsure if due to extinction or never existing in the first place, he sought out totally ethical genetic research and splicing
        to accomplish what the government likes to call "illegal" experiments. After years of failed atrocities...I mean, research...Matt and his completely ethical and not crazy
        scientists achieved the first living mythological being</p>
